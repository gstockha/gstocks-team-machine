# Team Profile Generator
  
  ## Description

  Using node, inquirer, and jest, I've constructed a terminal-based team profile generator for development projects. After running the application, the user will be prompted to fill out info for the various members of their team. This can be a manager, engineer, or intern as per javascript classes. Once complete, the user can see their newly outputted html document with their team members info laid out, with some info being interactable.
